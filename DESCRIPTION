Description: TidySeq simplifies RNA-Seq analysis for researchers with limited 
    programming experience. It provides a streamlined workflow for data import, 
    quality control, normalization, differential expression analysis, pathway 
    enrichment, and visualization with robust error handling and guidance.
    Includes an educational component that explains what each function does with
    example R code to help users understand the underlying processes.
